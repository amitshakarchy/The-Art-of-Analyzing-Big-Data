This repository includes all tasks' notebooks, final project, and final exam work created as part of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev course "The Art of Analyzing Big Data". 

The course covers techniques for mining massive datasets. In this course, we learned how to perform common tasks, such as classification, clustering analysis, and analysis of large datasets. Each of the tasks tackles different machine learning and big data issues. [Course web site](https://data4goodlab.github.io/lectures.html).
